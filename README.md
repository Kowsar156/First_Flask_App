# First_Flask_App
My first web application made with Flask

This application is basically a small fan page of one of my favorite peoples. This app can store, show fans and their small details as well as delete and update
them. It ain't much but it is an honest work, at least, as a starter.

Commands to run...

0. *you need python*
1. pip install virtualenv (1.1 --> virtualenv env *not needed to run, I just wrote here to remember what I did*)
2. Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted (*run this from Windows Powershell run as administrator, then enter "A" as the choice, then close Powershell*)
3. .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
4. pip install flask
5. pip install flask-sqlalchemy
6. python app.py


Psst...I had to run "python" then type the commands in the screenshot to create the database.
